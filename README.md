Hi, I'm Umut Veysel Durken.

I'm on my way to becoming a DevOps engineer. Right now I'm focused on learning how systems work under the hood, and how to automate things properly. Most of my time goes into practicing Linux, writing simple scripts, and understanding tools like Git, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

This account is where I keep track of what I'm working on. Most of the projects here are either small experiments or learning exercises.

I'm especially interested in:
- Terminal-based workflows
- Building things that remove repetitive work
- Understanding CI/CD from the ground up
- Creating simple and clear technical setups

As I keep learning, I’ll try to turn some of these into useful resources for others too.

If you’re working on similar things or just want to connect, you can reach me at durken.stack@gmail.com.
